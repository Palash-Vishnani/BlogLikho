                    <h1>Coding Blogs</h1>
                    <p class="lead">As a programmer, starting and maintaining a blog will be a significant boost to your
                        career and to your personal development. It may get you out of your comfort zone and require
                        some extra effort, but it is unquestionably worth doing.

                    <h1>Sports Blogs</h1>
                    <p class="lead">Sports are a great American pastime. We play sports, we watch sports, and we talk
                        about it – a lot. Some folks even have the desire to write about sports. One might desire to
                        reach a bigger audience than just family and friends with their views on sports, teams, and
                        players. The Internet and blogosphere provide that opportunity. Even if you’re not a
                        formally-trained sportswriter, you can gain an audience via your own sports blog..

                            your phone.
                            Keep practising – you don't have to publish everything you write.
                            Read other travel blogs analytically as well as for fun.
                            Don't put too much pressure on yourself.
                            Write about what you want.

                            <h1>Educational Blogs</h1>
                            <p class="lead">Starting a blog is one of the best ways to build an audience, get your ideas
                                out into the world, and possibly make some (or a lot) of money while doing what you
                                love. Everyone has different reasons for beginning a blog and different goals in mind
                                when they do so. Your personal path will dictate some of the choices you make along the
                                way. One thing that is true for everyone, however, is that the only way to succeed is to
                                get started.

                                Taking that first step can be a huge challenge, but by the end of this article, you
                                should have the tools you need to feel confident and prepared to start your educational
                                blog today.

                                <p class="lead">The first question I typically hear from potential clients is often asked sheepishly. “What should I … write about?” they ask. The beauty of a blog is that it can be about almost anything
                                    This is invariably the next question I hear. Sometimes it’s even the first question raised. Perhaps this is a result of post-traumatic stress from collegiate term papers, but length is a huge question on clients’ minds.
                                    There are many styles of business writing, from formal communication and contracts to more casual and spinny marketing copy.

                                        Technical blogging is a great way to share your expertise while building a potentially valuable readership. It can help you to document projects, or provide guidance to other web users. You can also monetize your content, or use your blog to market your services

                                            Nothing looks worse to a site’s visitors than a blog that hasn’t been updated in a year. Visitors might even wonder if the company is still in business.

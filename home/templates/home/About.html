  Hey, this is Palash Vishnani, a full stack developer and freelancer. A kick start to my
  journey of gaining interest in technical and development field took place when I chose science and
  mathematics (PCM) as my majors after 10th standard. I was studying in St. Mary’s Convent Senior Secondary
  School, Dewas (CBSC Board) but soon after 11th standard I dropped out of school and took admission in a
  non-attending dummy school Himalaya Academy (M.P Board), as I was preparing for a National level entrance
  exam. Currently I am studying in NMIMS, Mukesh Patel School of Technology Management & Engineering,
  pursuing B.Tech (Bachelor of Technology) focused on Information Technology. After exploring a whole lot of
  stuff and gaining insights about several programming and development related domains, I finally found a
  huge interest in full stack web application development and python. Thus, I usually apply django for the
  scripting part of a website, also the website you are seeing right now is build using HTML, CSS,
  JavaScript and Django.
              
  Always be curious and grateful for whatever you have in your life and make the most out of it because
  there are times when most of us are a bit doubtful about the decision that we had made in the past but
  keep exploring and you will definately find your domain of interest.
